            Evergreen trees stay green all year round. They donâ€™t lose their
            leaves in any season. Common examples include pine, cedar, and fir
            trees. These trees thrive in cold and mountainous regions, providing
            homes for birds and shade for animals.

            Evergreen trees are fascinating because they stay green all year,
            even in harsh weather. Their needle-shaped or waxy leaves help them
            save water, making them perfect for cold or dry regions. These trees
            not only provide oxygen but also act as natural windbreakers,
            protecting the environment. Did you know? Evergreen trees like pines
            and spruces are also used as Christmas trees, bringing joy to
            millions every year!

            Deciduous Trees

            Deciduous trees are unique because they shed their leaves every
            autumn, preparing for the colder months ahead. This process helps
            the trees conserve water and energy during winter when resources are
            scarce. In spring, they grow fresh, green leaves that help them make
            food through photosynthesis. Trees like oak, maple, and birch belong
            to this category and are known for their stunning fall colors,
            ranging from bright yellow to deep red. These trees not only enhance
            the beauty of landscapes but also provide habitats for various birds
            and animals.

            The vibrant colors of deciduous trees in autumn come from pigments
            already present in the leaves. When chlorophyll (the green pigment)
            breaks down, the hidden yellows, oranges, and reds are revealed,
            creating the magical fall scenery we love!

            Mangrove Trees

            Mangrove trees are remarkable plants that thrive in coastal areas
            where freshwater meets the salty sea. They have unique roots that
            grow above the water, allowing them to breathe and stay stable in
            muddy conditions. These trees play a crucial role in protecting
            shorelines from erosion and storms while acting as a natural filter
            for pollutants. Mangroves are also home to a diverse range of
            wildlife, including fish, crabs, and migratory birds. Beyond their
            environmental importance, they provide livelihoods for local
            communities through fishing and sustainable wood collection.

            Some mangrove trees can filter out salt from seawater through their
            roots, while others excrete salt through their leaves. This
            adaptation helps them survive in salty, challenging environments
            where most plants canâ€™t grow!
